**OSINT EXERCISE WRITEUPS 2**

- searched up about "Lectura en Movimento en Lima"
- found a website detailing the event and the person in the photo is identified as Juan Carlos Ruiz. 
- according to OEI's official page, Juan Carlos is one of its members, and is a civil engineer by profession. 
- on his lapel/suit, he seems to be wearing a OEI pin.
- looked up what this was about, and it turns out the Organization of Ibero-American States, or OEI for short, often brand pins to speakers and participants at their events
- the footage of Juan can be found on youtube (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVU-ei4Dunk)
