### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**
-I successfully solved the Riddle Registry forensics challenge and obtained the flag.
-I identified metadata as an important clue.
-I used a few tools and approaches such as: metadata2go for checking metadata, Base64 decoding to reveal hidden info and picoCTF webshell    with commands like wget, ls, and exiftool
-I was able to verify and redo the solution using a more hands-on technical method (webshell), which shows persistence and improvement.

**What challenged you?**
-I initially relied heavily on YouTube tutorials.
-Learning how to use the picoCTF webshell and command-line tools was a challenge.

**Key learning:**
-Metadata analysis is very important in digital forensics challenges.
-Tools like exiftool can reveal hidden file information.
-Base64 encoding is commonly used to hide flags or sensitive data.
-Webshell/CLI skills (wget, ls, file inspection) are essential in CTF forensics.

**Tomorrow's focus:**
-Complete the next challenges.
