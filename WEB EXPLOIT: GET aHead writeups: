WEB EXPLOIT: GET aHead writeups:

1.	Launch the instance first.
2.	Check the hints, it has 2 hints and it said, “Maybe you have more than 2 choices”, “Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses”
3.	I copied the given url to direct me to the website, then the website consists of 2 choices, red and blue for the color of the background page.
4.	So, I go the burpSuite, then go to PROXY tab, as default, the intercept is off, so we should turn in on, then, we click open browser for the burp to be able to launch the url site earlier.Copy and paste the url to the burp browser.
5.	As u can see, it appears to be having a request rn, so what I did, right click the available request and click send to repeater.
6.	Next, go to REPEATER tab, u can see the GET keyword in there, which means HTTP request method used to retrieve data, but, were not retrieving data, as the title indicates, we get a Head which means a header only so change the GET to HEAD and click send.
7.	And there, u will find the flag.
