1.	Launch the instance first.
2.	Check the hints, it has 2 hints and it said, “How do you inspect web code on a browser?”, “There's 3 parts”
3.	So, what I did, I go to web inspector, and there, it showed me the web codes. I scanned the code and in the html file, there is a note and there, I found out the first part of the flag. It said 1/3 of the flag, so meaning there’s 2 more to go.
4.	So knowingly, when creating a website, there should be a html file, a CSS file and a JS file, so I checked the CSS file first using web inspector, and viola, I found the 2/3 part of the flag.
5.	Next, I have gone to the JS File and there, I found the last part of the flag. 
6.	Combine all the parts of the flag and paste it to PICOCTF.
