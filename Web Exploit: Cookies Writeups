1. Launch the instance first.
2. From there, u can find a link to a webpage.Copy the link and input in the URL and it will bring u to a cookie webpage.
So first, there is a given text in the placeholder which is snickerdoodle and i assumed it's a clue, so a inputted in in the placeholder and it said "That is a cookie, but not special though" so meaning there is another set of cookies.
So, what i did, i inspected the webpage using web inspector and i go to the >> and clicked application. Then, since its about cookies, i clicked cookies and there is the webpage link which matches the given link earlier so i clicked it.
I noticed, when u input back the snickerdoodle, the value of the cookie changes to 0. So, what i did, i changed the 0 to 1 and clicked refreshed. The webpage changed from snickerdoodle to chocolate chip cookies.
I tried it again and again assuming there's plenty of cookies available and im just exploring when suddenly i encountered number 18, when i inputted number 18, it displayed the flag.
Copy the flag and paste it.
