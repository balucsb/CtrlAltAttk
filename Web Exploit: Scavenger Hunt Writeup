 First, Launch the instance.
I checked the hints and it said "You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer."
After I launched the instance, there is a link given, so i pasted it in the URL box and it directed me to a webpage.
So i explored the webpage, and in the webpage, it indicated that it is indicated using HTML,CSS and JavaScript, so i thought it as a clue.
So, what i did, i inspected the webpage and i went to sources and it has 3 available files which is index, mycss and myjs which is matching to the hint given earlier.
I first checked the index which is the HTML part, and in the last line of the codes, it has the first part of the flag.
So the html part gave a part of the flag, so i maybe there is also in the css and js part. So, i did go to the CSS codes and in the last part as well, it gave a 2nd part of the flag.
I explored the js part also, but unfortunately, it didnt give a part of the flag. Instead, it gave me a clue and it said "How can I keep Google from indexing my website?". So i searched on how can we keep Google from indexing my website and it gave me a response of adding robots.txt because robots.txt tells the searchengines on which should be indexed or not. So i added the robots.txt in the url using /robots.txt.
It gave me the 3rd part of the clue and it gave another clue and it said "I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?"
Since, it's an apache server, there is hidden files, so next, i changed the robots.txt to .htaccess. And there, it gave me the 4th part of the flag. And it also gave me another clue which is, "I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there."
So from that clue, it is referring to MAC OS proprietary  that holds attributes/meta-data about the folder it resides in and its called /.DS_Store. So, i replaced the .htaccess in the url and i change it to /.DS_Store and from there it gave me the 5th part of the flag and the flag is now completed.
